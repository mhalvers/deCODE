# COVID-19 vaccination side effects: frequency and symptoms

Shown are the most frequently reported adverse events up to and including February 19, 2021.  The frequency is reported as a percentage relative to the number of doses administered.

A total of 1,235 people reported adverse effects, however this represents only 0.088%, a very small fraction, of the more than 1.4 million doses administered.  This is equivalent to 88 reports per 100,000 doses, or in other words, 88 people in a city the size of Moncton, NB or Milton, ON.

A large majority of all adverse reactions, 84%, are minor and not considered serious.  Typical minor symptoms are pain, redness, swelling, itching, and tingling at the site of the injection.

Serious side effects are exceedingly rare.  Only 0.012%, or 12 people out of every 100,000, experience serious side effects.  There have been no confirmed deaths caused by COVID vaccination.
